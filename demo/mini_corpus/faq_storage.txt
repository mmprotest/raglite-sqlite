FAQ: Storage layout
-------------------

Q: Where does Raglite keep metadata?
A: Inside the `documents` table. Paths, titles, and MIME types stay normalized.

Q: How do I track chunk tags?
A: Each chunk row has a JSON column. Use `raglite add-tags` to patch keys atomically.

Q: Can I use network drives?
A: Yes, but enable WAL mode and copy the `.db` and `-wal` files together when backing up.
