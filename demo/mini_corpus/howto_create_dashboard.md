# How to create a status dashboard

1. Open Raglite Studio and sign in with your local profile.
2. Click **New Dashboard** and select the "Service Health" template.
3. Add the latency, uptime, and error rate widgets from the component tray.
4. Connect each widget to an existing monitor or paste static values for demos.
5. Share the dashboard snapshot with your team through the local share link.

Tip: dashboards refresh every minute; toggle "Live Preview" for second-by-second updates.
